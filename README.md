 # Bagh Chal

Bagh Chal, also known as the Tiger Game or Tiger and Goat Game, is a traditional strategy game from Nepal. This will guide you through the gameâ€™s rules, setup, and objectives.

## Objective

- **Tigers:** Capture the goats.
- **Goats:** Prevent the tigers from capturing all of them and trap the tigers so they cannot move.

## Board

The board is a 5x5 grid with additional diagonal lines connecting the corners, creating a star-like pattern. The intersections of these lines are the points where pieces can be placed.

## Pieces

- **Tigers:** 4 pieces
- **Goats:** 20 pieces

## Setup

1. **Tigers:** Start on the board in specific locations (typically at the four corners of the board).
2. **Goats:** Start off the board and are introduced into the game one at a time.

## Gameplay

### Tigers' Turn

- Tigers can move to any adjacent intersection along the lines (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
- Tigers capture goats by jumping over them to an empty spot directly on the other side (similar to a checkers capture).

### Goats' Turn

- Goats are placed on empty intersections, one at a time, until all 20 goats are on the board.
- After all goats are on the board, they can move to an adjacent intersection along the lines.

## Winning the Game

- **Tigers Win:** By capturing 6 goats so that it is impossible to block all tigers.
- **Goats Win:** By trapping all the tigers so they cannot make any legal moves.

## Strategy

- **For Tigers:** Focus on capturing goats efficiently and blocking their movement.
- **For Goats:** Aim to create a formation that limits the movement of tigers and avoid being captured.

## Additional Notes

- The game requires careful planning and strategic thinking from both players.
- The placement of goats can significantly influence the tigers' ability to capture or move.
